## Choice of Language

I chose to use Rust for this project because I wanted to try something different. Python is the language I know best, but I also wanted to show case my skills in other languages, in particular Rust, especially because it has a steep learning curve. I believe this demonstrates that I am capable of learning other languages and technologies, even if they are not listed on my CV.

Beyond this explanation, I also selected Rust because of its great error management. String operations such as the ones performed in this exercise are usually error prone. Other languages lack the ease of use that Rust has when it comes to error management, so I selected it for this task.
